# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple console application written in C# that allows users to play the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game is played in English, but can easily be adapted to other languages.

## Installation

To run the application, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Usage

To start the game, navigate to the root directory of the application in a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```
dotnet run
```


This will start the game and display a menu of choices for the user. The user should input their choice using the corresponding number (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) and press Enter. The computer will then randomly choose a move, and the result of the game will be displayed.
